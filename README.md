# MvcRouteTester

## What

MvcRouteTester is a .Net library to help unit testing ASP MVC route tables. It contains asserts for for both regular controllers and the Api controllers that are new in MVC 4.0. It is built in .Net 4.0 and ASP MVC 4.0.

It can be used with a simple or a fluent syntax, e.g either `RouteAssert.HasRoute(routes, "/home/index");` or `routes.ShouldMap("/home/index").To<HomeController>(x => x.Index());`

## Why

To aid automated testing by allowing unit tests on routes. Without such a library, the only way to automate a test that your ASP MVC application responds to a certain route is to make an integration test which fires up the whole MVC application in a web server and issues a Http request to that Url. Integration tests are good too, but unit tests run faster, easier to configure, are less fragile and generally come earlier in the coding lifecycle, so there are good reasons to use unit tests as a first line of defence against route configuration errors.

## How

MvcRouteTester throws an exception in order to fail a test on a route. This should work in any unit testing framework. However, if you want to integrate closer with NUnit or another unit testing framework, [this is easy to do and is documented here](https://github.com/AnthonySteele/MvcRouteTester/wiki/Integrating-with-NUnit).

## Credits

MvcRouteTester uses the basic ideas and code by [Phil Haack for testing MVC Routes](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/12/16/testing-routes-in-asp.net-mvc.aspx)
and by [Filip W for testing API Routes](http://www.strathweb.com/2012/08/testing-routes-in-asp-net-web-api/). I have told them both about this use of thier code and they are happy to see it here.

The idea behind writing strongly typed, fluent tests is from [MvcContrib](http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com). Initial code from MvcContrib hacked on by [Matt Gray](https://github.com/mattgray/) and [Daniel Kalotay](https://github.com/kalotay) at [7digital](http://www.7digital.com/). 

Pull requests on github and other bugs have come from:
- [Daniel Seifarth](http://github.com/redxeagle) got it working in .Net 4.0
- [Yves Reynhout](https://github.com/yreynhout) removed the dependency on a mocking framework.
- [Glenn Doten](https://github.com/gdoten) Prompted me to add the ability to specify a request body and to verify that it is bound.
- [Saladin](https://github.com/saladin) pointed out an issue where expectations could fail incorrectly when controller name and path differ in case.
- [Neil Stalker](https://github.com/nestalk) removed the dependency on NUnit.
- [Alex Brown](https://github.com/alexjamesbrown) reported a bug in parsing some fluent method expressions, and fixed a bug reading values into a nullable property on an input model.
- [Nicholasham](https://github.com/nicholasham) sent a patch to make custom routes that call into `HttpContext.RewritePath` work.
- [Lndcobra](https://github.com/lndcobra) added two features: `GeneratesActionUrl` for testing that correct web route links are generated by `Url.Action`, and much improved support for MVC Areas.
- [Geoff-Mci](https://github.com/geoff-mci) reported an issue with testing GUID parameters and suggested a fix.
- [Josefresno](https://github.com/josefresno) reported an issue when a field on the model bound from the body has the same name as a route param.

## Usage

### Web route usage

Assuming that the routes are declared along these lines: 

    routes = new RouteCollection();
    routes.MapRoute(
        name: "Default",
        url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
        defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional });

Then:
		
    RouteAssert.HasRoute(routes, "/home/index");

This assertion will fail if the route table does not have a route to `/home/index`


    var expectedRoute = new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = 42 };
    RouteAssert.HasRoute(routes, "/home/Index/42", expectedRoute);

This assertion will fail if the route table does not have a route to the url `/home/index/42`, and will also fail if it is not mapped to the expected controller, action and other parameters, using a anon-typed object to specify the expectations, [as per Phil Haack's article](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/12/16/testing-routes-in-asp.net-mvc.aspx). 

There are overloads of this method so if you don't like anonymous types, you can specify a controller name and action name as strings, or an `IDictionary<string, string>` to hold the controller name, action name and any other route parameters.

If you are using ASP MVC Areas, you can test that the right area is generated for the url, e.g.

    RouteAssert.HasRoute(routes, "/FooArea", new { Area = "FooArea", Controller = "Home", Action = "Index" });

### Other Web route tests
	
You can test that a route does not exist. This assertion will fail if a route **can** be found for the url `/foo/bar/fish/spon`.

    RouteAssert.NoRoute(routes, "/foo/bar/fish/spon");
  
You can test url generation (e.g. the output of `@Url.Action("Index", "Home")` in a view) with 

	RouteAssert.GeneratesActionUrl(routes, "/", "Index", "Home");
	
If you are using ASP MVC Areas, you can test that the right area is generated for the url, e.g.

	RouteAssert.GeneratesActionUrl(routes, "/SomeArea", new { action = "Index", controller = "Test", area = "SomeArea" });

	
### API route usage

Assuming that the routes are declared along these lines: 

    routes = new HttpConfiguration();
    config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
        name: "DefaultApi",
        routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{id}",
	    defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional });;

Then:

    RouteAssert.HasApiRoute(config, "/api/customer/1", HttpMethod.Get);

This assertion will fail if the config does not contain an Api route to the url `/api/customer/1` which responds to the Http Get method.

    var expectation = new { controller = "Customer", action= "get", id = "1" };
    RouteAssert.HasApiRoute(config, "/api/customer/1", HttpMethod.Get, expectation);

You can assert on the particulars of the api route using the same kinds of expectations as with Mvc routes.

    RouteAssert.ApiRouteDoesNotHaveMethod(config, "/api/customer/1", HttpMethod.Post);

This asserts that the Api route is valid, but that the controller there does not respond to the Http Post method.


    RouteAssert.NoApiRoute(config, "/pai/customer/1");

This asserts that the api route is not valid.

For more complete test examples, see the self-test code in MvcRouteTester.Test.

## API 

All methods are on the RouteAssert class.

### Web routes

    public static void HasRoute(RouteCollection routes, string url)

Test that a web route matching the url exists.

---

    public static void HasRoute(RouteCollection routes, string url, object expectations)
    public static void HasRoute(RouteCollection routes, string url, string controller, string action)
    public static void HasRoute(RouteCollection routes, string url, IDictionary<string, string> expectedProps)

Test that a web route matching the url exists, and that it meets expectations. The expectations can be given in different ways  - as an anon-typed object, as an IDictionary of names and values, or to just check the controller and action method names.

	public static void HasRoute(RouteCollection routes, string url, string body, IDictionary<string, string> expectedProps)

You can also specify a request body. This can be used for testing that post body data is mapped to route parameters. application/x-www-form-urlencoded values are supported.

---

    public static void NoRoute(RouteCollection routes, string url)
	
Test that a web route matching the url does not exist.

---

    public static void IsIgnoredRoute(RouteCollection routes, string url)
	
Test that the url is explicitly ignored, e.g. it matches a route added with `routes.IgnoreRoute`

---

    public static void IsNotIgnoredRoute(RouteCollection routes, string url)
	
Test that the url is not explicitly ignored, i.e. it matches a route which is not an ignored route.

---

	public static void GeneratesActionUrl(RouteCollection routes, string expectedUrl, object fromProps, HttpMethod httpMethod = null, string appPath = "/", string requestBody = null)
	public static void GeneratesActionUrl(RouteCollection routes, string expectedUrl, IDictionary<string, string> fromProps, string appPath = "/")
	public static void GeneratesActionUrl(RouteCollection routes, string expectedUrl, string action, string controller, HttpMethod httpMethod = null, string appPath = null, string requestBody = null)
	public static void GeneratesActionUrl(RouteCollection routes, HttpMethod httpMethod, string expectedUrl, IDictionary<string, string> fromProps, string appPath = null, string requestBody = null)
	public static void GeneratesActionUrl(RouteCollection routes, string expectedUrl, string action, HttpMethod httpMethod = null, string appPath = null, string requestBody = null)

Test that the expected url is generated by feeding data into `Url.Action`.

---

### Api routes

Api routes work a bit differently to web routes. Once an entry in the route table has been matched, the controller must be found to see if it has a method to respond to the given Http method, so there are two different levels of matching.

---

    public static void HasApiRoute(HttpConfiguration config, string url, HttpMethod httpMethod)

Test that an Api route matching the url exists, and that the controller can respond to the specified Http method.

---

    public static void HasApiRoute(HttpConfiguration config, string url, HttpMethod httpMethod, object expectations)
    public static void HasApiRoute(HttpConfiguration config, string url, HttpMethod httpMethod, string controller, string action)
    public static void HasApiRoute(HttpConfiguration config, string url, HttpMethod httpMethod, IDictionary<string, string> expectedProps)

Test that an api route matching the url exists, and that the controller can respond to the specified Http method and meets expectations. The expectations can be given in different ways - as an anon-typed object, as an IDictionary of names and values, or to just check the controller and action method names.

	public static void HasApiRoute(HttpConfiguration config, string url, HttpMethod httpMethod, string body, object expectations)

You can also specify a request body on an api request. This can be used for testing that post body data is mapped to route parameters. application/x-www-form-urlencoded values are supported.

---

    public static void NoApiRoute(HttpConfiguration config, string url)

Test that an Api route for the url does not exist. This means that it either does not match any pattern in the route table, or it does match a route table entry, but a matching controller cannot be found.

---

    public static void ApiRouteDoesNotHaveMethod(HttpConfiguration config, string url, HttpMethod httpMethod)

Asserts that an API route for the url exists but does not have the specified Http method.

---

    public static void ApiRouteDoesNotHaveMethod(HttpConfiguration config, string url, Type controllerType, HttpMethod httpMethod)
	

Asserts that the API route for the url exists to the specified controller, but does not have the specified Http method.
	
---

    public static void ApiRouteMatches(HttpConfiguration config, string url)

Test that an api route matching the url exists. This is a weaker test as it does not attempt to locate the controller, just tests that the url matches a route's pattern.

---

    public static void NoApiRouteMatches(HttpConfiguration config, string url)

Test that an api route matching the url does not exist. This means that it does not match the pattern of any entry in the route table.

### Fluent extensions

The fluent interface is a different way to use the same route testing engine. Many people prefer it as it is more stongly typed and may be more readable. It has the advantage that expressing parameters as type names and method calls rather than strings means that the test cannot be out of sync with your controller code. e.g. if you change a controller type name, the test will fail to compile, or if you use refactoring tools it will also be changed to match.

The fluent interface alows you to write code like:

     routes.ShouldMap("/home/index/32").To<HomeController>(x => x.Index(32));
	 routes.ShouldMap("fred.axd").ToIgnoredRoute();
	 routes.ShouldMap("/foo/bar/fish/spon").ToNoRoute();
	 routes.ShouldMap("/home/index/32").WithBody("Name=Fred&Id=12").To<HomeController>(x => x.Index(32));
	 routes.ShouldMap("/").From<HomeController>(x => x.Index());
	 
These use `RouteAssert.HasRoute`, `RouteAssert.IsIgnoredRoute`, `RouteAssert.NoRoute` and `RouteAssert.GeneratesActionUrl` respectively. the controller name, action name and action params are read from the types and expression given.

And for Api routes:

    config.ShouldMap("/api/customer/32").To<CustomerController>(HttpMethod.Get, x => x.Get(32));
	config.ShouldMap("/api/customer/32").WithBody("Name=Fred&Id=12").To<CustomerController>(HttpMethod.Post, x => x.Index(32));

	config.ShouldMap("/api/customer/32").ToNoMethod<CustomerController>(HttpMethod.Post);
	config.ShouldMap("/pai/customer/32").ToNoRoute();
	
These use `RouteAssert.HasApiRoute`, `RouteAssert.ApiRouteDoesNotHaveMethod`, `RouteAssert.NoApiRoute` respectively.

If you are using MVC areas, then as long as you use the standard layout of namespaces,  the area name will be extracted from your controller type name and tested against the area chosen by the route. e.g. if your controller's fully qualified type name is `MyWebApp.Areas.Blog.CommentController` then the expected area name will be "Blog".


### Model binding

[Model binding](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd410405%28v=VS.90%29.aspx) is the MVC framework's mapping from the URL to the controler method's parameters. This is one of the things that this library aims to test. Binding can be to simple types (int, string, bool etc.) or to a Model class. Suppose you have a controller

	public class FirstController: Controller
	{
		// simple model binding
		public ActionResult Index(int id, string name)
		{
			...
		}
	}

But for another controller you decide to bind incoming parameters into an model class, e.g.

	public class InputModel
	{
		public int Id { get; set; }
		public string Name { get; set; }
	}
	
	public class SecondController : Controller
	{
		// binding to an object of type 'InputModel'
		public ActionResult Index(InputModel data)
		{
			...
		}
	}

You can test both of these. With the expectation syntax, both controllers should be tested in the same way, e.g.

	var firstExpected = new { controller = "First", action = "Index", id = "1", name = "fred" };
	RouteAssert.HasRoute(routes, "/first/index/1/fred", firstExpected);

	var secondExpected = new { controller = "Second", action = "Index", id = "1", name = "fred" };
	RouteAssert.HasRoute(routes, "/second/index/1/fred", secondExpected);

However, with the fluent syntax the values will be read off the data in the lambda, so the two look tests slightly different to each other:

	routes.ShouldMap("/first/index/1/fred").To<FirstController>(x => x.Index(1, "Fred"));
	routes.ShouldMap("/second/index/1/fred").To<SecondController>(x => x.Index(new InputModel { Id = 1, Name = "fred" }));

The situation is the same for testing API Controllers.
